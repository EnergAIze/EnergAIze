# EnergAIze

Renewable power often referred as Clean Energy is booming, as innovation brings down costs and starts to deliver on the promise of a clean energy future. Solar and wind generation are breaking records and being integrated into the national electricity grid without compromising reliability.
Now that we have innovative and less-expensive ways to capture and retain wind and solar energy, renewables are becoming a more important power source. 
AI technology can help reduce costs, improve efficiency, and optimize energy practices while producing clean energy.

Our solution can improve access to affordable and reliable clean energy by:

-Focusing on planning to setup the system by utilizing the availability of natural sources like wind and/or sunlight.

-It can predict the energy demand which can help in terms of sizing/capacity.

-Also, help predicting the future consumption and help optimizing power generation.
